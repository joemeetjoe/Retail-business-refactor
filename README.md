# Retail Business Refactor

## Description

- I took this project on to learn how to refactor existing code, meet accessability standards on webpages, organize code better, and parent-child relationships relating to HTML tags. 
- This page allows a user to view what Horiseon can offer them as a provider of online services. This page shows its content in a consise, accessable way.
- I learned many things on this project: How to more effectively research topics related to programming, how to collaborate with others on a project, the relationship with parent-child elements, accessability standars, organization of code, how to refactor code, navigation of the git interface, and how to write a proper README.
